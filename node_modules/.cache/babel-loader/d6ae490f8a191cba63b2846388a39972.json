Skin to skin, bonding, and breastfeeding will be vital not only for the well-being of your baby, but to help protect you from postpartum hemorrhage.

I will stay with you for 2-3 hours after birth and I will make sure you feel confident in taking care of yourself and your baby before I leave your home.

Since my scope of practice only allows me to care for newborns up to 28 days, I will help facilitate a transfer of care to your chosen pediatric provider.
